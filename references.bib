  abstract  = {Until recently the gravitational N-body problem has been modelled numerically either by direct integration, in which the computation needed increases as N2, or by an iterative potential method in which the number of operations grows as N log N. Here we describe a novel method of directly calculating the force on N bodies that grows only as N log N. The technique uses a tree-structured hierarchical subdivision of space into cubic cells, each of which is recursively divided into eight subcells whenever more than one particle is found to occupy the same cell. This tree is constructed anew at every time step, avoiding ambiguity and tangling. Advantages over potential-solving codes are: accurate local interactions; freedom from geometrical assumptions and restrictions; and applicability to a wide class of systems, including (proto-)planetary, stellar, galactic and cosmological ones. Advantages over previous hierarchical tree-codes include simplicity and the possibility of rigorous analysis of error. Although we concentrate here on stellar dynamical applications, our techniques of efficiently handling a large number of long-range interactions and concentrating computational effort where most needed have potential applications in other areas of astrophysics as well.}

Computer simulation is an essential tool in studying the chemistry and physics of condensed matter, complementing and reinforcing both experiment and theory. Simulations provide detailed information about structure and dynamics, essential to understand the many fluid systems that play a key role in our daily lives: polymers, gels, colloidal suspensions, liquid crystals, biological membranes, and glasses. The second edition of this pioneering book aims to explain how simulation programs work, how to use them, and how to interpret the results, with examples of the latest research in this rapidly evolving field. Accompanying programs in Fortran and Python provide practical, hands-on, illustrations of the ideas in the text.},

    abstract = { The simulation of N particles interacting in a gravitational force field is useful in astrophysics, but such simulations become costly for large N. Representing the universe as a tree structure with the particles at the leaves and internal nodes labeled with the centers of mass of their descendants allows several simultaneous attacks on the computation time required by the problem. These approaches range from algorithmic changes (replacing an \$O(N^2 )\$ algorithm with an algorithm whose time complexity is believed to be \$O(N\log N)\$) to data structure modifications, code-tuning, and hardware modifications. The changes reduced the running time of a large problem \$(N = 10,000)\$ by a factor of four hundred. This paper describes both the particular program and the methodology underlying such speedups. }

  abstract = {Until recently, the gravitational N-body problem has been modelled numerically either by direct integration, in which the computation needed increases as N2, or by an iterative potential method in which the number of operations grows as N log N. Here, we describe a novel method of directly calculating the force on N bodies that grows only as N log N. The technique uses a tree-structured hierarchical subdivision of space into cubic cells, each of which is recursively divided into eight subcells whenever more than one particle is found to occupy the same cell. This tree is constructed anew at every time step, avoiding ambiguity and tangling. Advantages over potential-solving codes are: accurate local interactions; freedom from geometrical assumptions and restrictions; and applicability to a wide class of systems, including (proto-)planetary, stellar, galactic, and cosmological ones. Advantages over previous hierarchical tree-codes include simplicity and the possibility of rigorous analysis of error. Although we concentrate here on stellar dynamical applications, our techniques of efficiently handling a large number of long-range interactions and concentrating computational effort where most needed have potential applications in other areas of astrophysics as well.}

Unlike previously published schemes, the algorithm of this paper has an asymptotic CPU time estimate of \$O(N)\$, where N is the number of particles in the simulation, and does not depend on the statistics of the distribution for its efficient performance. The numerical examples we present indicate that it should be an algorithm of choice in many situations of practical interest. }

The code is based on a hierarchical tree of cubic cells and features mutual cell–cell interactions which are calculated via a Cartesian Taylor expansion in a symmetric way, such that total momentum is conserved. The code benefits from an improved and simple multipole acceptance criterion that reduces the force error and the computational effort. For N≳104, the computational costs are found empirically to rise sublinearly with N. For applications in stellar dynamics, this is the first competitive code with complexity O(N); it is faster than the standard tree code by a factor of 10 or more.}

abstract = {We present a new fast multipole method for particle simulations. The main feature of our algorithm is that it does not require the implementation of multipole expansions of the underlying kernel, and it is based only on kernel evaluations. Instead of using analytic expansions to represent the potential generated by sources inside a box of the hierarchical FMM tree, we use a continuous distribution of an equivalent density on a surface enclosing the box. To find this equivalent density, we match its potential to the potential of the original sources at a surface, in the far field, by solving local Dirichlet-type boundary value problems. The far-field evaluations are sparsified with singular value decomposition in 2D or fast Fourier transforms in 3D. We have tested the new method on the single and double layer operators for the Laplacian, the modified Laplacian, the Stokes, the modified Stokes, the Navier, and the modified Navier operators in two and three dimensions. Our numerical results indicate that our method compares very well with the best known implementations of the analytic FMM method for both the Laplacian and modified Laplacian kernels. Its advantage is the (relative) simplicity of the implementation and its immediate extension to more general kernels.}

    abstract = { Among the algorithms that are likely to play a major role in future exascale computing, the fast multipole method (fmm) appears as a rising star. Our previous recent work showed scaling of an fmm on gpu clusters, with problem sizes of the order of billions of unknowns. That work led to an extremely parallel fmm, scaling to thousands of gpus or tens of thousands of cpus. This paper reports on a campaign of performance tuning and scalability studies using multi-core cpus, on the Kraken supercomputer. All kernels in the fmm were parallelized using OpenMP, and a test using 107 particles randomly distributed in a cube showed 78\% efficiency on 8 threads. Tuning of the particle-to-particle kernel using single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions resulted in 4 × speed-up of the overall algorithm on single-core tests with 103–107 particles. Parallel scalability was studied in both strong and weak scaling. The strong scaling test used 108 particles and resulted in 93\% parallel efficiency on 2048 processes for the non-SIMD code and 54\% for the SIMD-optimized code (which was still 2 × faster). The weak scaling test used 106 particles per process, and resulted in 72\% efficiency on 32,768 processes, with the largest calculation taking about 40 seconds to evaluate more than 32 billion unknowns. This work builds up evidence for our view that fmm is poised to play a leading role in exascale computing, and we end the paper with a discussion of the features that make it a particularly favorable algorithm for the emerging heterogeneous and massively parallel architectural landscape. The code is open for unrestricted use under the MIT license. }
