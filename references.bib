  abstract  = {Until recently the gravitational N-body problem has been modelled numerically either by direct integration, in which the computation needed increases as N2, or by an iterative potential method in which the number of operations grows as N log N. Here we describe a novel method of directly calculating the force on N bodies that grows only as N log N. The technique uses a tree-structured hierarchical subdivision of space into cubic cells, each of which is recursively divided into eight subcells whenever more than one particle is found to occupy the same cell. This tree is constructed anew at every time step, avoiding ambiguity and tangling. Advantages over potential-solving codes are: accurate local interactions; freedom from geometrical assumptions and restrictions; and applicability to a wide class of systems, including (proto-)planetary, stellar, galactic and cosmological ones. Advantages over previous hierarchical tree-codes include simplicity and the possibility of rigorous analysis of error. Although we concentrate here on stellar dynamical applications, our techniques of efficiently handling a large number of long-range interactions and concentrating computational effort where most needed have potential applications in other areas of astrophysics as well.}

Computer simulation is an essential tool in studying the chemistry and physics of condensed matter, complementing and reinforcing both experiment and theory. Simulations provide detailed information about structure and dynamics, essential to understand the many fluid systems that play a key role in our daily lives: polymers, gels, colloidal suspensions, liquid crystals, biological membranes, and glasses. The second edition of this pioneering book aims to explain how simulation programs work, how to use them, and how to interpret the results, with examples of the latest research in this rapidly evolving field. Accompanying programs in Fortran and Python provide practical, hands-on, illustrations of the ideas in the text.},

    abstract = { The simulation of N particles interacting in a gravitational force field is useful in astrophysics, but such simulations become costly for large N. Representing the universe as a tree structure with the particles at the leaves and internal nodes labeled with the centers of mass of their descendants allows several simultaneous attacks on the computation time required by the problem. These approaches range from algorithmic changes (replacing an \$O(N^2 )\$ algorithm with an algorithm whose time complexity is believed to be \$O(N\log N)\$) to data structure modifications, code-tuning, and hardware modifications. The changes reduced the running time of a large problem \$(N = 10,000)\$ by a factor of four hundred. This paper describes both the particular program and the methodology underlying such speedups. }

This tree is constructed anew at every time step, avoiding ambiguity and tangling. Advantages over potential-solving codes are: accurate local interactions; freedom from geometrical assumptions and restrictions; and applicability to a wide class of systems, including (proto-)planetary, stellar, galactic, and cosmological ones. Advantages over previous hierarchical tree-codes include simplicity and the possibility of rigorous analysis of error. Although we concentrate here on stellar dynamical applications, our techniques of efficiently handling a large number of long-range interactions and concentrating computational effort where most needed have potential applications in other areas of astrophysics as well.}

Unlike previously published schemes, the algorithm of this paper has an asymptotic CPU time estimate of \$O(N)\$, where N is the number of particles in the simulation, and does not depend on the statistics of the distribution for its efficient performance. The numerical examples we present indicate that it should be an algorithm of choice in many situations of practical interest. }

The code is based on a hierarchical tree of cubic cells and features mutual cell–cell interactions which are calculated via a Cartesian Taylor expansion in a symmetric way, such that total momentum is conserved. The code benefits from an improved and simple multipole acceptance criterion that reduces the force error and the computational effort. For N≳104, the computational costs are found empirically to rise sublinearly with N. For applications in stellar dynamics, this is the first competitive code with complexity O(N); it is faster than the standard tree code by a factor of 10 or more.}

The main feature of our algorithm is that it does not require the implementation of multipole expansions of the underlying kernel, and it is based only on kernel evaluations. Instead of using analytic expansions to represent the potential generated by sources inside a box of the hierarchical FMM tree, we use a continuous distribution of an equivalent density on a surface enclosing the box. To find this equivalent density, we match its potential to the potential of the original sources at a surface, in the far field, by solving local Dirichlet-type boundary value problems. The far-field evaluations are sparsified with singular value decomposition in 2D or fast Fourier transforms in 3D. We have tested the new method on the single and double layer operators for the Laplacian, the modified Laplacian, the Stokes, the modified Stokes, the Navier, and the modified Navier operators in two and three dimensions. Our numerical results indicate that our method compares very well with the best known implementations of the analytic FMM method for both the Laplacian and modified Laplacian kernels. Its advantage is the (relative) simplicity of the implementation and its immediate extension to more general kernels.}

    abstract = { Among the algorithms that are likely to play a major role in future exascale computing, the fast multipole method (fmm) appears as a rising star. Our previous recent work showed scaling of an fmm on gpu clusters, with problem sizes of the order of billions of unknowns. That work led to an extremely parallel fmm, scaling to thousands of gpus or tens of thousands of cpus. This paper reports on a campaign of performance tuning and scalability studies using multi-core cpus, on the Kraken supercomputer. All kernels in the fmm were parallelized using OpenMP, and a test using 107 particles randomly distributed in a cube showed 78\% efficiency on 8 threads. Tuning of the particle-to-particle kernel using single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions resulted in 4 × speed-up of the overall algorithm on single-core tests with 103–107 particles. Parallel scalability was studied in both strong and weak scaling. The strong scaling test used 108 particles and resulted in 93\% parallel efficiency on 2048 processes for the non-SIMD code and 54\% for the SIMD-optimized code (which was still 2 × faster). The weak scaling test used 106 particles per process, and resulted in 72\% efficiency on 32,768 processes, with the largest calculation taking about 40 seconds to evaluate more than 32 billion unknowns. This work builds up evidence for our view that fmm is poised to play a leading role in exascale computing, and we end the paper with a discussion of the features that make it a particularly favorable algorithm for the emerging heterogeneous and massively parallel architectural landscape. The code is open for unrestricted use under the MIT license. }

journal = {The Astronomical Journal},
abstract = {This study employs numerical simulations to explore the relationship between the dynamical instability of planetary systems and the uniformity of planetary masses within the system, quantified by the Gini index. Our findings reveal a significant correlation between system stability and mass uniformity. Specifically, planetary systems with higher mass uniformity demonstrate increased stability, particularly when they are distant from first-order mean motion resonances. In general, for nonresonant planetary systems with a constant total mass, non-equal-mass systems are less stable than equal mass systems for a given spacing in units of mutual Hill radius. This instability may arise from the equipartition of the total random energy, which can lead to higher eccentricities in smaller planets, ultimately destabilizing the system. This work suggests that the observed mass uniformity within multiplanet systems detected by Kepler may result from a combination of survival bias and ongoing dynamical evolution processes.}

The basic idea is to improve the performance of the code on heavily vector-oriented machines such as the Cyber 205 by exploiting the fact that nearby particles tend to have very similar interaction lists. By building an interaction list good everywhere within a cell containing a modest number of particles and reusing this interaction list for each particle in the cell in turn, the balance of computation can be shifted from recursive descent to force summation. Instead of vectorizing tree descent, this scheme simply avoids it in favor of force summation, which is quite easy to vectorize. A welcome side-effect of this modification is that the force calculation, which now treats a larger fraction of the local interactions exactly, is significantly more accurate than the unmodified method.}

Este algoritmo resuelve aproximadamente el problema de N-cuerpos y es conocido por lograr orden al agrupar cuerpos cercanos en un solo individuo cuando son observados desde una distancia suficientemente lejana. Además, se concibió un esquema original para agrupar esos cuerpos; esta prueba de concepto resultó funcionar con precisión. Asimismo, se analizó el rango de validez del prototipo y se contrastó con el algoritmo de suma directa mediante un conjunto seleccionado de ejemplos. La implementación del algoritmo BH depende en gran medida de una estructura de datos de tipo árbol profundamente anidada. Como tal, su manipulación es fundamentalmente recursiva y altamente compleja. Esta es la razón por la que se incluyó una explicación extendida, con dibujos y esquemas, de la estrategia de contabilidad involucrada en su uso. Finalmente, se subió el código completo a la plataforma GitHub y, por lo tanto, se puso a disposición del público.},

  abstract  = {Multi-core processors provide time-efficient and cost-effective solutions to execute the algorithms for complex physical systems. However, to efficiently exploit the processing capabilities of the underlying architectures, the applications executing on multi-core processors must be parallelized. Conventionally, the applications for high-performance computing (HPC) are written in native (programming) languages. However, several researchers have argued that Java can be an excellent alternative for writing HPC applications. To gauge the comparative performance of Java parallel platforms, a benchmark study is required considering some real HPC applications. In this study, as a pioneer application, Java-based parallel platforms, namely Java thread API, JavaSymphony, and MPJ Express, are used to parallelize and benchmark the Barnes–Hut algorithm to simulate the N-body physical system of celestial objects. The parallel implementations of the Barnes–Hut algorithm are tested for performance on shared memory multi-core architectures. The hardware-level performance analysis involving the parameters like the number of instructions executed by the CPU, level-1 and level-3 cache misses, and the number of main memory accesses is conducted to investigate the insights of the attained performances. The celestial objects up to one million are simulated, and the results revealed that the JavaSymphony-based implementation of the Barnes–Hut algorithm produces better results as compared to the other employed parallel frameworks.}

abstract = {N-body algorithms for long-range unscreened interactions like gravity belong to a class of highly irregular problems whose optimal solution is a challenging task for present-day massively parallel computers. In this paper we describe a strategy for optimal memory and work distribution which we have applied to our parallel implementation of the Barnes \& Hut (1986) recursive tree scheme on a Cray T3D using the CRAFT programming environment. We have performed a series of tests to find an optimal data distribution in the T3D memory, and to identify a strategy for the Dynamic Load Balance in order to obtain good performances when running large simulations (more than 10 million particles). The results of tests show that the step duration depends on two main factors: the data locality and the T3D network contention. Increasing data locality we are able to minimize the step duration if the closest bodies (direct interaction) tend to be located in the same PE local memory (contiguous block subdivision, high granularity), whereas the tree properties have a fine grain distributuion. In a very large simulation, due to network contention, an unbalanced load arises. To remedy this we have devised an automatic work redistribution mechanism which provided a good Dynamic Load Balance at the price of an insignificant overhead.}

abstract = {N-body codes for performing simulations of the origin and evolution of the large-scale structure of the universe have improved significantly over the past decade in terms of both the resolution achieved and the reduction of the CPU time. However, state-of-the-art N-body codes hardly allow one to deal with particle numbers larger than a few 107, even on the largest parallel systems. In order to allow simulations with larger resolution, we have first reconsidered the grouping strategy as described in J. Barnes (1990, J. Comput. Phys.87, 161) (hereafter B90) and applied it with some modifications to our WDSH–PT (Work and Data SHaring–Parallel Tree) code (U. Becciani et al., 1996, Comput. Phys. Comm.99, 1). In the first part of this paper we will give a short description of the code adopting the algorithm of J. E. Barnes and P. Hut (1986, Nature324, 446) and in particular the memory and work distribution strategy applied to describe the data distribution on a CC–NUMA machine like the CRAY–T3E system. In very large simulations (typically N≥107), due to network contention and the formation of clusters of galaxies, an uneven load easily verifies. To remedy this, we have devised an automatic work redistribution mechanism which provided a good dynamic load balance without adding significant overhead. In the second part of the paper we describe the modification to the Barnes grouping strategy we have devised to improve the performance of the WDSH–PT code. We will use the property that nearby particles have similar interaction lists. This idea has been checked in B90, where an interaction list is built which applies everywhere within a cell Cgroup containing a small number of particles Ncrit. B90 reuses this interaction list for each particle p∈Cgroup in the cell in turn. We will assume each particle p to have the same interaction list. We consider that the agent force Fp on a particle p can be decomposed into two terms Fp=Ffar+Fnear. The first term Ffar is the same for each particle in the cell and is generated by the interaction between a hypothetical particle placed in the center of mass of the Cgroup and the farther cells contained in the interaction list. Fnear is different for each particle p and is generated by the interaction between p and the elements near Cgroup. Thus it has been possible to reduce the CPU time and increase the code performance. This enables us to run simulations with a large number of particles (N∼107–109) in nonprohibitive CPU times.}

abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter describes the first CUDA implementation of the classical Barnes Hut n-body algorithm that runs entirely on the GPU. The Barnes Hut force-calculation algorithm is widely used in n-body simulations such as modeling the motion of galaxies. It hierarchically decomposes the space around the bodies into successively smaller boxes, called cells, and computes summary information for the bodies contained in each cell, allowing the algorithm to quickly approximate the forces (e.g., gravitational, electric, or magnetic) that the n bodies induce upon each other. The Barnes Hut algorithm is challenging to implement efficiently in CUDA because it repeatedly builds and traverses an irregular tree-based data structure, it performs a lot of pointer-chasing memory operations, and it is typically expressed recursively. GPU-specific operations such as thread-voting functions are exploited to greatly improve performance and make use of fence instructions to implement lightweight synchronization without atomic operations. The main conclusion of the work is that GPUs can be used to accelerate irregular codes, not just regular codes. However, a great deal of programming effort is required to achieve good performance. The biggest performance win, though, came from turning some of the unique architectural features of GPUs, which are often regarded as performance hurdles for irregular codes, into assets. Future direction indicates workings on writing high-performing CUDA implementations for other irregular algorithms.}

  abstract  = {Recently, general-purpose computation on graphics processing units (GPGPU) has become an increasingly popular field of study as graphics processing units (GPUs) continue to be proposed as high performance and relatively low cost implementation platforms for scientific computing applications. Among these applications figure astrophysical N-body simulations, which form one of the most challenging problems in computational science. However, in most reported studies, a simple O(N²) algorithm was used for GPGPUs, and the resulting performances were not observed to be better than those of conventional CPUs that were based on more optimized O(N log N) algorithms such as the tree algorithm or the particle-particle particle-mesh algorithm. Because of the difficulty in getting efficient implementations of such algorithms on GPUs, a GPU cluster had no practical advantage over general-purpose PC clusters for N-body simulations. In this paper, we report a new method for efficient parallel implementation of the tree algorithm on GPUs. Our novel tree code allows the realization of an N-body simulation on a GPU cluster at a much higher performance than that on general PC clusters. We practically performed a cosmological simulation with 562 million particles on a GPU cluster using 128 NVIDIA GeForce 8800GTS GPUs at an overall cost of 168172 USD. We obtained a sustained performance of 20.1 Tflops, which when normalized against a general-purpose CPU implementation leads to a performance of 8.50 Tflops. The achieved cost/performance was hence a mere 19.8 USD/Gflops which shows}

  abstract  = {Computer simulation with Monte Carlo is an important tool to investigate the function and equilibrium properties of many biological and soft matter materials solvable in solvents. The appropriate treatment of long-range electrostatic interaction is essential for these charged systems, but remains a challenging problem for large-scale simulations. We have developed an efficient Barnes-Hut treecode algorithm for electrostatic evaluation in Monte Carlo simulations of Coulomb many-body systems. The algorithm is based on a divide-and-conquer strategy and fast update of the octree data structure in each trial move through a local adjustment procedure. We test the accuracy of the tree algorithm, and use it to perform computer simulations of electric double layer near a spherical interface. It has been shown that the computational cost of the Monte Carlo method with treecode acceleration scales as log N in each move. For a typical system with ten thousand particles, by using the new algorithm, the speed has been improved by two orders of magnitude from the direct summation.}

To overcome this obstacle we have developed an innovative parallelization strategy for Barnes–Hut tree codes on present and upcoming HPC multicore architectures. This scheme, based on a combined MPI–Pthreads approach, permits an efficient overlap of computation and data exchange. We highlight the capabilities of this method on the full IBM Blue Gene/P system JUGENE at Jülich Supercomputing Centre and demonstrate scaling across 294,912 cores with up to 2,048,000,000 particles. Applying our implementation pepc to laser–plasma interaction and vortex particle methods close to the continuum limit, we demonstrate its potential for ground-breaking advances in large-scale particle simulations.}

We achieve this by significantly improving the Kepler solver and ensuring numerical stability of coordinate transformations to and from Jacobi coordinates. These refinements allow us to remove the linear secular trend in the energy error that is present in other implementations. For small enough timesteps, we achieve Brouwer's law, i.e. the energy error is dominated by an unbiased random walk due to floating-point round-off errors. We implement symplectic correctors up to order 11 that significantly reduce the energy error. We also implement a symplectic tangent map for the variational equations. This allows us to efficiently calculate two widely used chaos indicators the Lyapunov characteristic number and the Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits. whfast is freely available as a flexible C package, as a shared library, and as an easy-to-use python module.},

abstract="Many real-world search and optimization problems are naturally posed as non-linear programming problems having multiple objectives. Due to the lack of suitable solution techniques, such problems were artificially converted into a single-objective problem and solved. The difficulty arose because such problems give rise to a set of trade-off optimal solutions (known as Pareto-optimal solutions), instead of a single optimum solution. It then becomes important to find not just one Pareto-optimal solution, but as many of them as possible. This is because any two such solutions constitutes a trade-off among the objectives and users would be in a better position to make a choice when many such trade-off solutions are unveiled.",

  abstract = {A new heuristic approach for minimizing possibly nonlinear and non-differentiable continuous space functions is presented. By means of an extensive testbed it is demonstrated that the new method converges faster and with more certainty than many other acclaimed global optimization methods. The new method requires few control variables, is robust, easy to use, and lends itself very well to parallel computation.}
